Script: *measure-CountingSort.ps1*
========================

This PowerShell script measures the speed of the CountingSort algorithm.
CountingSort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects according to keys
that are small positive integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It
operates by counting the number of objects that possess distinct key values, and
applying prefix sum on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in
the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference
between the maximum key value and the minimum key value, so it is only suitable for direct
use in situations where the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number
of items. It is often used as a subroutine in radix sort, another sorting algorithm, which
can handle larger keys more efficiently.

Parameters
----------
```powershell
PS> ./measure-CountingSort.ps1 [[-numIntegers] <Int32>] [<CommonParameters>]

-numIntegers <Int32>
    Specifies the number of integers to sort
    
    Required?                    false
    Position?                    1
    Default value                1000
    Accept pipeline input?       false
    Aliases                      
    Accept wildcard characters?  false

[<CommonParameters>]
    This script supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug, ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, 
    WarningVariable, OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable.
```

Example

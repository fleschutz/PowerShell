Script: *measure-HeapSort.ps1*
========================

This PowerShell script measures the speed of the HeapSort algorithm.
HeapSort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heapsort can be thought of as an
improved selection sort: like selection sort, heapsort divides its input into a sorted
and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting
the largest element from it and inserting it into the sorted region. Unlike selection
sort, heapsort does not waste time with a linear-time scan of the unsorted region;
rather, heap sort maintains the unsorted region in a heap data structure to more quickly
find the largest element in each step.

Parameters
----------
```powershell
PS> ./measure-HeapSort.ps1 [[-numIntegers] <Int32>] [<CommonParameters>]

-numIntegers <Int32>
    Specifies the number of integers to sort
    
    Required?                    false
    Position?                    1
    Default value                1000
    Accept pipeline input?       false
    Aliases                      
    Accept wildcard characters?  false

[<CommonParameters>]
    This script supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug, ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, 
    WarningVariable, OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable.
```

Example
-------
```powershell
PS> ./measure-HeapSort.ps1
ðŸ§­ 0.614 sec to sort 1000 integers by HeapSort

```

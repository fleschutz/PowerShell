Script: *measure-BubbleSort.ps1*
========================

This PowerShell script measures the speed of the BubbleSort algorithm.
BubbleSort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list,
compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass
through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a
comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.

Parameters
----------
```powershell
PS> ./measure-BubbleSort.ps1 [[-numIntegers] <Int32>] [<CommonParameters>]

-numIntegers <Int32>
    Specifies the number of integers to sort
    
    Required?                    false
    Position?                    1
    Default value                1000
    Accept pipeline input?       false
    Aliases                      
    Accept wildcard characters?  false

[<CommonParameters>]
    This script supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug, ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, 
    WarningVariable, OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable.
```

Example
-------
```powershell
PS> ./measure-BubbleSort.ps1
ðŸ§­ 0.729 sec to sort 1000 integers by BubbleSort

```

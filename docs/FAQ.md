</details>


<details><summary>How to write good PowerShell scripts?</summary>
 
**Good PowerShell scripts are both user-friendly and platform-independent. As a starting point I recommend the following:**

* Use the `<verb>-<noun>.ps1` scheme for filenames (e.g. *new-symlink.ps1*). Official approved verbs can be found here: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands)
* Use **UTF-8 BOM** encoding to support Unicode characters in the script.
* Add a **comment-based help** at the beginning with: `.SYNOPSIS`, `.DESCRIPTION`, `.PARAMETER`, `.EXAMPLE`, `.LINK`, and `.NOTES`.
* Check the **requirements** for the script, e.g. `#Requires -RunAsAdministrator`, or `#Requires -Version 3`
* Prefer **command-line options**, else ask the user for help
* Recommended is **Set-StrictMode -Version Latest** to enable additional error checking.
* For readibility use **lowerCamelCase** to name variables, functions, etc.
* Set execute file permissions for Linux: **chmod a+rx <filename>**
* On success exit with error code 0 (**exit 0**), otherwise print the error with keyword **ERROR:** (to support log parsers) and exit the error code (mostly 1)
